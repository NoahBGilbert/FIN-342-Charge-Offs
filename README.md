# FIN-342-Charge-Offs
A repository containing code for FIN 342 assignment on predicting charge offs using Python.

For the second homework assignment, students will need to fork this respository directly to their own GitHub account, so they can make their own edits in their version of the code.

Then, students need to submit the following on the canvas assignment for homework two by 11:59PM on 09/30/18:
  1)  A link to your code stored on Github
  2)  The confidence matrix and accompanying graph of your improved prediction
  3)  A short description of what you did, where in the code (line numbers), and why that produces these results.
  4)  Suggestion(s) for additional improvements in the form of a short description, line of code, etc.
